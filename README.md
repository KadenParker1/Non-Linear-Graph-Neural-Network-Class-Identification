# Non-Linear-Graph-Neural-Network-Class-Identification


Generating synthetic graphs and then training GNNS on class identification for a given node in the graph. 


polar.py creates nonlinear graph data and trains a gnn on class identification for single uses

polarwauto.py streamlines polar.py and is set up for running many times

boringgraph.py creates linearly seperable graph data
